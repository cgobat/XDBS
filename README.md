## Important files

- `./master.csv`: CSV (comma-separated values) file of the XDBS catalog. 

- `./XDBS.dat`: AAS Machine-Readable Table of the XDBS catalog. 

- `./XDBS.ipynb`: Python notebook with source code that produces the catalog. 

## Catalog access
In addition to the data files listed above, we have also made available an interactive website for plotting the multi-wavelength properties of the catalog. It can be found at https://home.gwu.edu/~kargaltsev/XDBS/.
